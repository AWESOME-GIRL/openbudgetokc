We [meet](http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Open-Oakland/) Tuesdays 6â€“9:30pm at City Hall as part of [OpenOakland](http://openoakland.org/) hack night. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Open Budget Oakland** promotes a deeper understanding of the city budget, enabling citizens, officials, and other stakeholders to engage in more informed dialogue about how the City of Oakland currently works and how it should in the future. We turn raw data into interactive visualizations, share tools for people to create their own, and provide a forum for collective dialogue about the details and the (various) big pictures.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
